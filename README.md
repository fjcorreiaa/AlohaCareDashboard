# Aloha Care Cluster Analysis Project

## Overview

This project applies cluster analysis techniques to segment data into meaningful groups. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can support decision-making across various applications, such as patient segmentation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw data for clustering.

- **Clustering Methods:** Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms, including:

  - K-Means
  - Hierarchical Clustering

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Validation of clustering results using metrics such as Silhouette Score.

- **Visualization:** Comprehensive visualizations of clusters, including:

  - Scatter plots
  - Tables

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  ```
  pandas
  numpy
